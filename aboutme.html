<h1>About Me</h1>

<body>
  <p>My career goal is to become a Registered Nurse and what I am going to do to achieve this goal is to attend a 4 year college. This is my career goal for the future because it makes me feel delighted to know that I was able to assist someone with their alarming medical concerns.

The reason why I would be a good Registered Nurse is because I possess many of the qualities that are required in becoming one. Some of the qualities I have that relate to this job is being caring, responsible, and understanding. I am caring when it comes down to people and their troubled situations. Whenever I encounter someone who’s less fortunate, I try to be understanding of their situation and try to help as much as possible. 

Overall, I would be a good Registered Nurse because not only am I bilingual but I am also a multi-tasker. This makes me the best candidate for this position due to being caring and understanding of one’s situation.Thank you for taking your time to read what I would want my career to consist of and feel free to check out the rest of my website.
